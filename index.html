GUI Assignment: Creating Your First Web Page
Name: Anthony Lawlor, Anthony_Lawlor@student.uml.edu
Date Created: 9/11/2022
Description: This webpage was built using the atom editor which I have used in the past for building my own personal website.
This website is very basic and just involves changing the background to a photo, adding text, adding a photo, and adding links in a dropdown menu.
